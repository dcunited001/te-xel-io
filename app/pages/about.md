<h3>How to become great at anything.</h3>

<p>Find your weakness, practice and make it a strength. Find what's difficult and make it effortless.
Make it everything you do, your soul focus, and you will be great. Don't stop to settle
for what feels great, don't let others convince you that you're already great and rob you of your desire to practice.
Examine yourself from others' points of view.  What do they find great and what weaknesses do they see?  Don't forget
to give back to those around you and empower your friends because they'll be invaluable later on.  But most of
all make sure that you have fun excelling, because otherwise being great doesn't mean much at all.</p>
