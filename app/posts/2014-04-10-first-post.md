This is a blog where I can boast about my technological feats.

### Static FTW

It's a *completely static* site, built using the [Lineman](https://linemanjs.com) front-end framework.
I used the [Lineman Blog Template](https://github.com/linemanjs/lineman-blog-template) as a starting point
and added [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to make it shiny and responsive.  Try playing around
with different screen sizes and see how the page reacts.

### A Markdown Blog Template with Bootstrap

I also created a [blog template](https://github.com/dcunited001/lineman-blog-bootstrap-template) with
bootstrap ready to go with a few other features as well.  That way, I
can easily create a separate blog for skating, etc.  All of my sites
will be hosted on subdomains on *xel.io* because IO domains are $70 and
I'm cheap like that.  Also, xel is a pretty generic word-stem.

Anyone with a text editor can use this blog template, writing posts in 
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).  Well, you might 
need to know a little bit about Git, DNS and hosting.  But, it's really simple
and it's static.
