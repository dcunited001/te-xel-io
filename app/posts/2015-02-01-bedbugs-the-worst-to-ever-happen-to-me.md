> **Note:** I'm putting this article out a bit early, but still need to add some details.  The overall story is here, but I'm going to add some more details later tonight.

So I'm going to tell you about the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my life, so far.  While it wasn't so bad in itself and could've been much worse, it was moreso the circumstances of my life in which it happened that made it so terrible. This occurred in Boulder, CO in July 2013, *immediately* after I had moved there from Denver. 

A few people have heard parts of this story.  Some have heard all of it.  But I'm tired of retelling it.  I want this in its entireity, in one place.  I have dealt with this on my own long enough and I want to get it off my chest.  If you helped me during this time, I cannot thank you enough.  I am so glad the people at **Boulder Fuse** and **SSD**, **the Boulder Hackerspace**, were trying to help me out. 

My life was extremely chaotic at this time.  I didn't feel good.  I was depressed and extremely stressed.  I'm pretty sure I had some psychosomatic symptoms, where the level of stress and my emotional states were actually causing me physical problems as well.  At the time, I thought it was the bedbug poison that surrounded me at home.  I did not feel like myself and stopped physical activites like skateboarding because of this wierd feeling of weakness in my nerves/muscles.  It was probably self-induced by my state of mind, but I was spending hours of time on Wikipedia looking into ALS, MS, etc, but couldn't find anything that matched.  At one point, I had pins and needles in one leg, though it wasn't falling asleep.  Anyways ...

### So what's that like?  You know, being a * **Pariah**?*

Picture yourself, having just moved to a new area an hour away, though you're 25 hours from *home*.  You've been living in Colorado for 4 months now and you've made a few good friends in Denver.  But, you've just moved to Boulder after having a severe case of "the grass is greener."  

Then, three weeks after you arrive, your new roommate, who you barely know, informs you that your new apartment has bedbugs.  At the end of June, he leaves for the [Rainbow Gathering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Gathering) in Montana, leaving you alone.  You could go if you want.  However, you don't have much desire to hang out with thousands of hippies doing fingerprints of acid until they shit themselves.  Instead, you're interviewing for a new job and need to get your shit straight in preparation.

> So uhh ... there's certain things that happen to me ...  I don't think they happen to other people ...

You're a fairly quiet person, very introspective.  And you haven't had a chance to make real friends yet.  By real friends, I mean the kind of people you feel comfortable asking to help you deal with some serious problems.  Problems which would would surely mean these true friends would have to be willing take on some pain in order to help you out.  And sometimes you just don't know how to ask for help.

I took this picture on the first day I got paid and the day I started new job at JumpCloud.  Things were starting to look up, but there was still no light at the end of the tunnel.

### TL; DR;

I'm starting to write a bit too much, so I'm going to try to sum up how the situation impacted my life first.  Then I'll go into more details, including what happened.  I was psychologyically traumatized by this.  As in PTSD.  Maybe I wasn't in a warzone, but 6 to 12 months afterwards, I was constantly reliving these situations.  Constantly replaying memories and ruminating, trying to establish what I could have done to limit the impact of these situations.  Trying to figure out what I did wrong, why I deserved to go through this.

> Bedbugs are like an STD.  It's like an STD, where you don't even have to **fuck** someone to * **fuck** * someone!  Instead of being *sexually transmitted*, it's more like *'reaching-out-for-help-transmitted'* -- in my case, I couldn't ask for help without hurting those people who gave me help!

Basically, I ended up in a situation where I was isolated and had no support network.  I even lost my phone right at the worst time and had a hard time contacting my family for about three weeks.  I had to deal with this severe problem that I was deathly afraid of talking to anyone about, since I likely couldn't prevent this infestation from spreading.

#### Coworkers at [Boulder Fuse](http://boulderfuse.com).

I was working at an extremely cool coworking space in Boulder at the time.  [Boulder Fuse](https://www.facebook.com/BoulderFuse), a great place, run by great people.  I was afraid of getting them infected -- and may have, since these bedbugs can hitch a ride on your belongings.  So to combat this, I wanted to minimize my time spent at home.

So, I adopted a 48-hour sleep schedule.  On alternating nights, I stayed awake at the Boulder Fuse's amazing office, fueling passion on my projects with adderal and countless packs of American Spirit.  I only made the trek home when it was necessary.  Sometimes, I passed out on the creekbed outside, during the day.  When I returned home, I only reluctantly slept in my bed -- a pretty amazing mattress my friend had left in his place for me.  Instead, I slept outside on the patio!

> Wow, your place on Craigslist looks great!! You look pretty cool yourself.  We could be great friends.  You don't mind a few bedbugs do you?  All you have to do is burn your furniture and clothes while you pay hundreds of dollars for a terminator to visit several times.  Meanwhile, for months you infect all your friends and neighbors that live close by.  No biggie, right?

While I didn't have any furniture, I was also afraid of this problem following me to the next apartment I found myself in.  I ultimately found myself homeless immediately after starting a new job.  I had plenty of money, but I was so busy, I couldn't search for an apartment.  Not to mention that I didn't have a car.  After my first lease was up, I stored my belongings -- which, thankfully, was no more than I could [barely] carry at one time -- in my friend's pickup truck.  Rain or shine, it don't make no matta.

>  The week I moved out was the EXACT time that I lost my phone!!!  I really can't use enough exclamation points to identify how this is **the** *perfect* **WORST** time for this to happen!

#### [2013/8/2 Shooting Star](http://instagram.com/p/Z6vTWzy5eb/?modal=true) - taken at the beginning of my homelessness.

For a period of three weeks, I had a really tough time finding a place to stay.  Remember, I had only lived in Boulder for a few weeks!  I started sleeping at the office.  I tried to keep it on the D/L, but my manager at Jumpcloud put an end to this pretty quickly, for insurance reasons.  My manager and teammates recommended getting a hotel, just until I could sort things out.

I stayed in a hotel for a few nights at a time.  This was especially annoying, as it ate into my savings for a lease on an apartment.  The hotel kicked me out after a few nights.  And so, instead of searching for an apartment, I found myself, alone, dragging everything I owned in Colorado along with me around Downtown Boulder.  To my workmates, I'm pretty sure I looked like a pathetic piece of shit who couldn't even handle the most basic needs in his personal life.  A great first impression for a new work environment, *doncha know?!*

In this picture, my hat's inside out, showing the Mandelbrot patterns inside.  It's what's inside that counts, right?  I was lucky enough to get a room here.  I remember that at this time, all the students' parents were in Boulder, helping their kids move in.  This made it really difficult to find even a hotel room!

Oh, and I was suffering from a bout a Irritable Bowel Syndrome for those few weeks.  Another great impression, right?

My manager at Jumpcloud wouldn't let me keep my stuff at the office -- again, for insurance reasons.  So, I occasionally found myself storing my possessions openly in the parking garage below our office, while I was at work.  I got to the point where staying at the hotel was completely eating up my savings for a place, so I had to do something else.  

I found this blanket I could use, which at night I carried with me to the outskirts of Boulder.  Rain was my worst enemy and I slept under the open sky.  And amazing, I didn't lose my mind through all of this, which I attribute to my Buddhist beliefs.   I told myself that I was camping and that I should appreciate the chance I got to do this because -- let's be honest -- I'm not the guy who usually goes camping.  I love the outdoors, don't get me wrong.  I just don't usually prompt myself with the opportunity.  

![My Campgounds](/img/posts/2015-02-01-bedbugs-the-worst-to-ever-happen-to-me/the-campgrounds.jpg)

#### A picture of the exact spot I camped at, above that twisted pine. In Boulder, camping is illegal.

> Actually, one of my pipedreams is technology that enable us to work remotely on a mountainside ... like techno-hippie hermits ...

Anyways, so how was I showering?  Luckily, my colleagues had recently suggested we all get a gym membership, so I showered there.  How was I changing?  I kept extra changes of clothes and underwear in my desk!  Additionally, these became particularly useful when, for whatever reason, a toilet exploded on me at work after I took a shit!!  So, again...

> So uhh ... there's certain things that happen to me ...  I don't think they happen to other people ...

Anyways, for at least a week, my schedule was the following: 

- **6:00am:** Wake up and walk back into Boulder.
- **7:00am:** Arrive at the office before anyone else and find some clothes I had stashed in my desk.
- **7:15am:** Run to the gym, luckily a few blocks away -- because I like to keep it simple.
- **7:30am:** Phony 15 minute workout to justify being at the gym to take a shower.
- **7:45am:** Quick shower.
- **8:00am:** Back to the office to arrive early, which admittedly was a change of pace.
- **9:00am:** Work for a while.
- **6:00pm:** Get off from work.  I liked to stay late.  I didn't have anyone else to hang out with really.
- **7:00pm:** I stayed close to the office, so I could return after everyone left. To search for apartments, not catch up on work.

And for the rest of the night, I would desparately search listings on Craigslist, while just as desparately trying to find somewhere to stay with that night.  Most of these listings were were out of my price range.  Or at least exceeded my current savings at the time -- I could afford to live there, but couldn't afford the security deposit.  And this is all occuring at the same time University of Colorado Boulder is returning to school, increasing the amount of competition for places to live.

I even had to wear my swim trunks at one point because I hadn't had a chance do laundry.  I used the excuse that I was going tubing with some friends later, which I was.  It was one of the few times I got to see friends from Virginia.  I felt pretty fucked up for not being able to let them crash at my place, but I couldn't bring myself to tell them what was really going on!  I didn't know them too terribly well.

Admittedly, a lot of this is my fault for not taking care of finding a new place earlier.  However, I was seriously overwhelmed by my new job *and* the moral delimma that bedbugs posed.  Fortunately, after about 2 weeks of being homeless, I had found my next place.  I wasn't able to move in just yet, but my new roommate was generous enough to allow me to store my stuff in his garage.  I cannot emphasize enough how this simplified my life at the time.

The day before I moved out, I posted this pic following on Facebook, along with the following caption.  My apartment complex neighbor across the way had Tibetan prayer flags hanging up and it got me thinking.

> Tibetan prayer flags give me this warm fuzzy feeling. To me, they mean that no matter how cold things may seem or how far up you are, someone's been there before. And that's a relief right? 

### Acting Against My Beliefs

I had recently become more enthusiastic about embracing Buddhism.  Many of these ideas had come to save me from much of the pain I had experienced in my life, years prior.  I had learned that the pain I was experiencing was really a result of the cage my beliefs had constructed around myself.  All I had to do was reshape my beliefs and I could escape.  Briefly studying aspects of Buddhism had provided me with tools that I had found infinitely valuable, over and over again.  

I had even begun to try vegitarianism, except for eggs and fish.  And if you know me, this is a huge step for me, not easy at all.  While I don't each much pork or beef, it's a huge change in my habits.  However, being vegitarian is moreso a conclusion of Buddhism than a foundational tenet, as some believe.  That is, if you truly act as one with the beliefs of Buddhism, you would be vegetarian because you desire suffering to end for all sentient life.  Yet, there are many more important insights about life and its experiences that most would likely accept before finding themselves there.  

Yet suddenly, I found myself alone in a situation where I could easily escape, supposedly, if I might just forsake one of Buddhism's most important conclusions: that all forms of life are sacred.  Even those forms of life which you'd rather not have to deal with: parasites and disease bearing life.  All I had to do was poison my apartment -- although there is no guarantee this would work because bedbugs are notoriously difficult to eliminate.  

Additionally, there are the karmic consequences of selfishly acting on my own beliefs.  Failing to act would allow this infestation to spread to my neighbors, forcing them to commit the same sins I had forbid myself to commit.  It would create the exact same situation for others.  And maybe this aspect of the problem seems silly to you -- just $#@!'ing deal with the problem already -- but to me, this was yet another aspect of the already severe problem I was dealing with!

I spent many nights at home balling my eyes out over this issue.  Partially because it opened my eyes to the possibility of similar problems which cannot be defined in black and white.

### The Toxicity of our City

Another aspect of the dilemma is that I'm a "chemophobe."  In other words, I do not want to have to live in a home with neurotoxic chemicals.  My roommate brought home bedbug poison and they don't even list the chemicals in that stuff.  If you know that many bugsprays and mosquito repellants contain neurotoxins capable of contributing to Parkinson's disease by interfering with your body's dopaminergic systems, you're going to be pretty wary of unlisted chemicals which are probably neurotoxic or poisonous to humans, too.  

After all, life evolved in similar environments and much life has common ancestry.  While not necessarily true, what is detrimental to one species or form of life is often toxic to others.  Our genes and systems are more similar than we realize.  It's actually epigenetics and the expression of genes which accounts for the diversity of life and NOT the genes themselves!

In other words, various forms of life are built with "lego pieces," which are mostly the same.  It's how these pieces are snapped together that makes the difference.  Some branches in the tree of life contain unique pieces, but we share many of the more important pieces.  There are many exceptions and this reasoning can't be used to determine a specific safety profile or general scientific policy, but it's still a useful generalization.  More on this topic in a separate article.

### May 2013

Taking it back a few months, and I've just lost the coolest job that I've ever had.  I worked at Weedmaps, where I happily worked with a team of great people.  Best of all, I felt that I was working for a company where I could be myself.  While we obviously couldn't smoke at work, I didn't have to hide my marijuana usage from other employees.  I wasn't afraid that marijuana usage would be politically used against me.  I was contributing to an industry I was passionate about.  Everything was perfect.

Well, there was "that one guy" who I thought was being a bit manipulative, divisive and political.  However, I've learned that this is usually the rule and not the exception.  Whenever you're in an environment where there's an incentive for people to gain advantage -- or avoid losing their job -- you're going to end up with some people like this.

If it's just that one guy, then your problems really aren't that bad.  If you deal with these people in the right way, you can come to an understanding, though it may not be easy.  Mostly, you need to make sure everyone sees how interactions are playing out between this person and others.  Again, more on this topic very soon.

So, I lost this job after a new manager came on board and they switched technologies.  A few Ruby guys were let go, all at the same time.  I saw it coming, but they gave us a fairly good severance package.  I didn't want to leave, but are you really going to argue when you walk out of the door with like $5,000 and your last paycheck on the way?

This was the middle of May.  I will finish this article soon ... More later ...
